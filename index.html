                            <h4>Pythagoras</h4>
                            <p>Pythagoras was an ancient Ionian Greek philosopher and the founder of Pthagoreanism. His
                                political and religious teachings were well known and influenced the philosophies of
                                Plato,
                                Aristotle and through them, Western philosophy. The teaching most identified with
                                Pythagoras
                                is
                                “metempsychosis” which holds that every soul is immortal and upon death, enters into a
                                new
                                body.
                                Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical discoveries, including the Pythagorean
                                theorem.

                                Pythagoreans believed that all things were made of numbers. The number one representted
                                the
                                origin of all things and the number two represented matter. The number three was an
                                “ideal
                                number” because it had a beginning, middle and an end according to the Pythagoreans.
                                Furthermore
                                they believed that odd numbers were masculine and that even numbers were feminine. The
                                number
                                five represented marriage because it was the sum of two and three.</p>

                            <h4>The Theorem</h4>
                            <p>In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry
                                among
                                the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the area of the square whose side is
                                the
                                hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares of the other two sides. This
                                theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the legs a, b and the
                                hypotenuse c.
                                <br><br>

                                The theorem has been proven numerous times by many different methods - possibly the most
                                for
                                any mathematical theorem. The theorem can be generalized in various ways: to
                                higher-dimensonal spaces and to object that are not right triangles.

                        He was one of the Seven Sages of Greece. Many, most notably Aristotle, regarded him as the first
                        philosopher in the Greek tradition. He is often referred to as the Father of Science.

                        Thales is recognized for breaking from the use of mythology to explain the world and the
                        universe, instead explaining by offering naturalistic theories and hypotheses. Thales
                        hypothesised that the nature of matter was a single material substance: water.

                    <p>Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece.
                        Taught by Plato, he was he founder of the Lyceum, the school of philosophy and the Aristotelian
                        tradition. His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, logic, ethics
                        and many more.

                        Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was
                        above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as
                        problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on
                        almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary
                        philosophical discussion.
