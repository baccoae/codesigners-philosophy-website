                            <h4>Pythagoras</h4>
                            <p>Pythagoras was an ancient Ionian Greek philosopher and the founder of Pthagoreanism. His
                                political and religious teachings were well known and influenced the philosophies of
                                Plato,
                                Aristotle and through them, Western philosophy. The teaching most identified with
                                Pythagoras
                                is
                                “metempsychosis” which holds that every soul is immortal and upon death, enters into a
                                new
                                body.
                                Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical discoveries, including the Pythagorean
                                theorem.

                                Pythagoreans believed that all things were made of numbers. The number one representted
                                the
                                origin of all things and the number two represented matter. The number three was an
                                “ideal
                                number” because it had a beginning, middle and an end according to the Pythagoreans.
                                Furthermore
                                they believed that odd numbers were masculine and that even numbers were feminine. The
                                number
                                five represented marriage because it was the sum of two and three.</p>

                            <h4>The Theorem</h4>
                            <p>In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry
                                among
                                the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the area of the square whose side is
                                the
                                hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares of the other two sides. This
                                theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the legs a, b and the
                                hypotenuse c.
                                <br><br>

                                The theorem has been proven numerous times by many different methods - possibly the most
                                for
                                any mathematical theorem. The theorem can be generalized in various ways: to
                                higher-dimensonal spaces and to object that are not right triangles.

                    <h4>Thales</h4>
                    <p>Thales or Thales of Miletus was a Greek mathematician, astronomer and pre-Socratic philosopher.
                        He was one of the Seven Sages of Greece. Many, most notably Aristotle, regarded him as the first
                        philosopher in the Greek tradition. He is often referred to as the Father of Science.

                        Thales is recognized for breaking from the use of mythology to explain the world and the
                        universe, instead explaining by offering naturalistic theories and hypotheses. Thales
                        hypothesised that the nature of matter was a single material substance: water.

                    <p>Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece.
                        Taught by Plato, he was he founder of the Lyceum, the school of philosophy and the Aristotelian
                        tradition. His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, logic, ethics
                        and many more.

                        Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was
                        above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as
                        problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on
                        almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary
                        philosophical discussion.

                        <h4>The creation myth</h4>
                        <p>The ancient Greek philosophers believed that the world began with emptiness that they
                            called Chaos.
                            This proceeded with the formation of the earliest deities that represented different
                            aspects or layers that were necessary for the creation of a functioning universe. These
                            three gods were Gaea, Tartarus, and Eros. Gaea was considered as the embodiment of the
                            Earth, Tartarus was representing the underworld - the place where the wicked go tor
                            suffering and the Titans get punished for their deeds, Eros was the embodiment of
                            sensual love.

                            After the creation of love, Gaea and Chaos started to create everthing that we sense but
                            also beyond our senses that exisits in the universe.

                            This all led to the birth of the darkness - Erebus, and night - Nyx. This union gave
                            life to the bright upper air - Aether and the Day - Hemera. Afterwards the Fate - Moros,
                            the Doom - Ker, the Death - Thanatos, the Sleep Hypnos, the Dreams - Oneiroi, the Old
                            Age - Geras, the Pain - Oizus, the Revenge - Nemesis, the Strife - Eris, the Deceit -
                            Apate, the Sexual Pleasure - Philotes, the Blame - Momos, and the Daughters of the
                            Evening - Hesperides.</p>

                                    This is the first part of the human soul. It functions using logic and rational
                                    thinking
                                    in every decision and action it makes. It is easy for this part to differenciate

                                    What Plato firmly believed in was that all the people who are responsible for
                                    governing
                                    anyone should be deeply connected to their rational part to make decisions that are
                                    just
                                    and not based on one’s feelings or emotions.

                                    The human soul’s spirited part is the most heated and strongly emotional. Despite
                                    being
                                    responsible for all the strong emotion a person feels, it is especially focused on
                                    anger
                                    and temper.

                                    <br><br>

                                    It “comes to life”, for example, when the one feels like they’ve been mistreated or
                                    when
                                    one faces a great challenge and feels the urge to push themselves to the limits to
                                    overcome it.

                                    <br><br>

                                    Spirited element thrives when winning or being praised and is also related to the
                                    desire
                                    to be and do good.

                                    and comfort. It is responsible for everything from the most basic desires such as
                                    sense
                                    of starvation and cravings, thirst, and fatigue.

                                    <br><br>

                                    This part actually includes uncountable amount of appetites that, according to
                                    Plato’s
                                    teachings, are often going against one another and causing trouble in the psyche.

                        <p>During 800 to 650 B.C.E. the oligarchs were in charge of ruling the Greek cities. In fact,
                            the word “oligarch” means “few” in Greek and the way of governing was named so because the
                            power was often in the hands of a small group of wealthy men.

                            The men who became oligarchs had usually inherited land from their families and became rich
                            from that, in some cases they were merchants as well.
                            Oligarchy was very unbalanced way of ruling which was clearly in favour of the rich since
                            the oligarchs made decisions and passed laws that were in favour of increasing their wealth.
                            <br><br>
                            Since the poor weren’t happy with this situation, the leaders of the army were usually
